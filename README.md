# Challenge-1-refactoring-

## Description
In this repo I refactor an existing code for the the webpage of Horiseon in order to improve accessibility. 
I engaged in ths projcet for practice, specifically to learn how to "clean up," organize, and modify HTML code so that it will better serve accessibility and readability. I learned about the difference of semantic and none-semantic HTML elements and the importance of alt attributes for images in regard to accessibility, and the sequential order of elements and their potenial overwriting, clear and concise title elements in regard to search engine optimization, as well as well-structured code for improved readability.
